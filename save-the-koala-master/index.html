                <h1>Koalas are cute but they're also under threat in their Aussie homeland!</h1>
                <p>Koalas are well-known as an icon of Australia and many people who visit Australia as tourists hope to see and hold a koala. But it's less well known that koalas in the wild are facing unprecedented pressure as their trees are cleared, existing habitat becomes more vulnerable and isolated and more roads bisect their territories resulting in more koalas being run over.</p>

                <p>Loss of koala habitat is the major threat facing koalas today. Since white settlement of Australia, roughly 80% of the koala’s habitat has been destroyed and of what remains, most occurs on privately owned land and almost none is protected.</p>
